  <h1><strong>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</strong>
  </h1>
  <p>During this foundation part, I have learned that my ego does definitely take a hit when I don’t understand a concept and have to ask for help. Although it really shouldn’t be that way as that is literally the best way to learn. I also found that I like to get the job completely done, I don’t want to just finish it the next day, I want it to be done and finished, but finished well and efficiently. I also found that because of my ego I would totally think that something was a piece of cake, and boom, I was sat right back, because it was definitely not a piece of cake, and actually took me 4 hours to complete. 
  </p>
  <h1><strong>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</strong></h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Values are so  important in our everyday lives, they are the guiding principles that can influence the decisions we make and the actions we take. In programming, values such as accuracy, efficiency, and security can help to ensure that code is written in a responsible and effective way. By prioritizing these values, programmers can create software that is reliable, safe, and high-performing.
    </li>
    <li>Empathy is a powerful skill that involves the ability to understand and share the feelings, experiences, and perspectives of others. In programming, empathy can help developers to anticipate the needs and preferences of end-users, leading to the creation of software that is intuitive and user-friendly. By putting themselves in the shoes of their users, programmers can design more effective products. In addition to its importance in programming, empathy is also a crucial skill for success in collaborative environments, such as workplaces. By understanding and sharing the emotions and perspectives of colleagues and team members, individuals can build positive relationships, improve communication, resolve conflicts, and promote effective leadership. For example, empathy can foster better collaboration, more open communication, and a supportive work environment.
    </li>
    <li>Self-awareness: Self-awareness involves an understanding of one's own emotions, strengths, and weaknesses. In programming, self-awareness can help programmers to recognize when they are struggling with a particular task or concept, and to seek help or guidance when necessary. By being self-aware, programmers can also be more effective in collaborating with others and communicating their ideas and needs.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h1><strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong>
  </h1>
  <p>How important it is to reflect on not only what I’ve learnt during that week, but also on how I felt. It has given me a better sense of how to improve my self awareness and be able to recognise my strengths and weaknesses. 
  </p>
  <h1><strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?  </strong>
  </h1>
  <p>Starting to learn new concepts and skills can be challenging, and I found that to be the case with core learning. Of all the activities, however, I found meditation at the beginning to be particularly difficult. The idea of sitting still and listening to my thoughts for an extended period of time challenged my thinking and required me to focus my attention in a new way. Despite the initial difficulties, I persisted with daily practice, and over time, I have come to appreciate the value of this practice as a part of my routine. Meditation has become an integral part of my study routine, and I wouldn't want to start my learning process any other way. By practicing this skill regularly, I have developed greater focus and awareness, which has helped me to learn more effectively and efficiently.
  </p>
  <h1><strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?  </strong>
  </h1>
  <p>I believe that as a programming school DEV Academy, spends so much time on core learning, because programming is about more than just mastering technical skills - it involves developing a range of soft skills that are valuable both in and out of the workplace. Effective communication, self-awareness, conflict resolution, and empathy are just a few examples of the critical skills required to excel in programming. In addition to understanding how to write code, programming also requires individuals to be mindful of the needs of others and themselves. By honing these soft skills, programmers can build more positive relationships with their colleagues, foster more effective teamwork, and create better products that meet the needs of users. 
  </p>
  <h1><strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong>
  </h1>
  <p>No, I do not feel that the time spent studying core learning was a waste of time. On the contrary, I found it to be highly beneficial and valuable in many ways. By practicing self-awareness and mindfulness techniques, I have gained a better understanding of myself and my thought processes, which has helped me to approach learning and problem-solving with a clearer, more focused mind. Furthermore, the skills and concepts I learned through core learning have been highly transferable to my programming studies. By being more aware of my own mental state and emotions, I have been able to manage stress and frustration more effectively, allowing me to remain focused and productive during programming sessions.
