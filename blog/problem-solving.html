    <h1><strong>1. blocked on a simple problem:</strong>
      </h1>

    <p>I once had a mental block on a mathematics assignment in uni, I was totally dumbfounded on what on earth I was supposed to do. I’ll be honest, I left it for a couple days because it was just overwhelming me too much, not the best decision considering it was then due the next day by the time I started, but you live and you learn. Once I did look at it again, I changed my mindset, I would look at it in smaller sections rather than this big lump of work. 
    </p>

    <p> That’s what I ended up doing, section by section, using various research resources. I felt overwhelmed during the process, but once I got the first section done, it went way easier and the ball was now rolling. The hardest was just getting over the hurdle of just starting. Once I had finished and submitted it I felt so relieved to get it out of the way. I learned that I just need to start, and in order to do that I don’t need to look at it as such a huge challenge, and rather just do it section by section which isn’t as intimidating to start.  
    </p>

    <h1><strong> 2. elegantly solved a problem:</strong>
    </h1>

    <p>Last year, I had covid for 2 weeks and was isolated, I got it pretty bad, I was down at my old flat. Basically, I was already there longer than I should have been, but the weather was also horrendous and my car couldn’t take on those snowy conditions, so once I got the all clear, I was getting ready to leave the next day. I took myself to the shops to get some dinner after starving for 2 weeks, got home and didn’t realize I had gone over a huge metal thing in my driveway, so my tire was flat.  
    </p>

    <p>Instead of stressing myself out by feeling that everything was going wrong, I took a step back and had a big breath of air. I began searching for mechanic-tire places that weren’t too far from my flat, as I really couldn't drive my car more than 400m max. I was hopeful as there was a mechanic just down the road, so I called up, and it was closed and wasn't opening until Monday….3 days away. The other mechanics were more than 3 km away and although I asked them if it were possible to drive me, I would pay double, they declined. I was absolutely dumbfounded at what to do.
    </p>

    <p>But instead of feeling sad, I started looking at the spare tire in the car, looking at all the parts that I would need to take off, and put on this spare tire. With a lot of googling, and youtubying, I found a somewhat decent tutorial. It took a lot of jumping to get the bolts to come off, and took me at least 3 hours by myself. But I managed to take off the flat tire and put on the new tire. Which allowed me to drive to the mechanic the next morning and get home. I felt so accomplished during this, honestly felt amazing. This experience showed me that I am capable of doing so much more than I think I am, and there is no point limiting my mindset. When I want to do something, I can and will do it.

    <h1> <strong>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:
        </strong>
    </h1>

    <p>Pseudocode:
      <br> Using this as a rough draft for a final program is going to take some more practice. I understand what it’s used for and why, and I have tried it out when I was really stuck, but it can be hard to write something out when I don’t even understand the question itself. I know I will become much more confident with pseudocode when I understand what I am doing more.   
    </p>

    <p>Trying something:
      <br> I am confident in trying something for sure. There is no harm in trying. And the fun thing is you can always change it. At this point, nothing I do is going to ruin an entire program. Plus, I enjoy researching the problems, and then seeing someone write something similar, so I give it a go in my code. Always worth a shot. 
    </p>

    <p>Rubber ducky method:
      <br> I absolutely love this method. I have used a similar method for quite some time, just talking out loud, but actually talking to an inanimate object helps so much. Verbalizing my thoughts really helps me understand what’s going on, and usually I end up finding the solution myself. I am very confident in using this method as a fresh perspective.  
    </p>

    <p>Reading error messages:
      <br> I am not as confident in reading error messages. I will need more practice. But I am definitely far better than I was last week, so that’s progress. Can only go up from here. 
    </p>

    <p>Console.logging: 
      <br> Semi confident with console.logging , I understand it, use it, but still need practice. 
    </p>

    <p>Googling:
      <br> Confident with googling , I have had a lottttt of practice this week. 
    </p>

    <p>Asking your peers for help:
      <br>I did manage to ask this week which I was proud of. Not that confident in it, but this was the first step in developing that confidence. 
    </p>

    <p>Asking coaches for help
      <br> I would say I’m a little more confident than asking peers, but the only person I fully feel confident to ask is Yosan. Although I did ask about the superfizzbuzz in a zoom with Gerard which I was happy with. 
    </p>

    <p>Improving your process with reflection
      <br>I have really enjoyed the reflection side of things. It’s so easy to just continue typing, and the more I go, the more my true feelings and thoughts actually come out. Although it’s still intimidating knowing someone else is reading my thoughts. I have gained a lot of confidence in my reflections over the last couple weeks though that's for sure.
