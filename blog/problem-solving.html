    <h1><strong>1. blocked on a simple problem:</strong>
      </h1>

    <p>What was the problem:
      <br>I was stuck on a problem called superfizzbuzz. Basically I had to write a function called super_fizzbuzz which takes an array of numbers as its input. It then loops over each number in the list, checking to see if it's divisible by 3, by 5, or by both. Then based on this check, it will add "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", to a new list. When it's finished looping over all the numbers, it returns the new "fizzbuzzed" list. The program does that for you and gives you back a new list with all the changed numbers.
    </p>

    <p> What problem-solving techniques did you use: 
      <br> Even though it wasn’t a large challenge, it was enough for me to get overwhelmed.  Therefore, when I realized this was going to be a bit more challenging for me, I decided to break it down into small sections for me to understand. I read over the instructions step by step, breaking it down. I then did a lot of research on the web to find something similar. When I couldn’t find something, I reached out for help, and even watched a zoom livestream to ask what to do because I was lost. I continued more searching on youtube, and google, and managed to figure it out. So a lot of persistence.  
    </p>

    <p> How did you feel throughout the process: 
      <br> It definitely involved a lot of down moments,  when I was like well crap this looks impossible. But with the help of some food and exercise breaks, I was able to look at it again, and knowing that we could actually use .map, helped a lot, and I managed to finish it…after 5 hours, but hey it’s done now yay! 
    </p>

    <p> What did you learn: 
      <br> I learnt that even though it may take me a very long time to get something, or I still don’t fully understand it, there will be those light bulb moments when you’re like damn wow I actually get it!
    </p>

    <h1><strong> 2. elegantly solved a problem:</strong>
    </h1>

    <p> What was the problem:
      <br> It was the ‘capitalize’ section in the Kata. Imagine you have a sentence, and you want to make it look bouje by capitalizing the first letter of each word. This function takes that sentence as a string and uses something called .map() to go through each word in the sentence. Then for each of the words, it capitalizes the first letter. And then, it returns the modified sentence as a string, which means the output is still a sentence, but now with each word starting with a capital letter.
    </p>

    <p> What problem-solving techniques did you use: 
      <br> I broke it down into small sections. Researched the question to try and find something similar, created a step-by-step plan for how I would carry it out. And wrote the actual code. 
    </p>

    <p> How did you feel throughout the process:
      <br> I really felt like I had a  light bulb moment, I finally figured out where the const, slice, split all come in. It made me feel excited for a few seconds. 
    </p>

    <p> What did you learn: 
      <br> I learnt that although I had such a hard time the day before, continuing to learn is far better than anything else. Step by step. Don’t worry about how fast others are going, focus on my own pace. 
    </p>

    <h1> <strong>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:
        </strong>
    </h1>

    <p>Pseudocode:
      <br> Using this as a rough draft for a final program is going to take some more practice. I understand what it’s used for and why, and I have tried it out when I was really stuck, but it can be hard to write something out when I don’t even understand the question itself. I know I will become much more confident with pseudocode when I understand what I am doing more.   
    </p>

    <p>Trying something:
      <br> I am confident in trying something for sure. There is no harm in trying. And the fun thing is you can always change it. At this point, nothing I do is going to ruin an entire program. Plus, I enjoy researching the problems, and then seeing someone write something similar, so I give it a go in my code. Always worth a shot. 
    </p>

    <p>Rubber ducky method:
      <br> I absolutely love this method. I have used a similar method for quite some time, just talking out loud, but actually talking to an inanimate object helps so much. Verbalizing my thoughts really helps me understand what’s going on, and usually I end up finding the solution myself. I am very confident in using this method as a fresh perspective.  
    </p>

    <p>Reading error messages:
      <br> I am not as confident in reading error messages. I will need more practice. But I am definitely far better than I was last week, so that’s progress. Can only go up from here. 
    </p>

    <p>Console.logging: 
      <br> Semi confident with console.logging , I understand it, use it, but still need practice. 
    </p>

    <p>Googling:
      <br> Confident with googling , I have had a lottttt of practice this week. 
    </p>

    <p>Asking your peers for help:
      <br>I did manage to ask this week which I was proud of. Not that confident in it, but this was the first step in developing that confidence. 
    </p>

    <p>Asking coaches for help
      <br> I would say I’m a little more confident than asking peers, but the only person I fully feel confident to ask is Yosan. Although I did ask about the superfizzbuzz in a zoom with Gerard which I was happy with. 
    </p>

    <p>Improving your process with reflection
      <br>I have really enjoyed the reflection side of things. It’s so easy to just continue typing, and the more I go, the more my true feelings and thoughts actually come out. Although it’s still intimidating knowing someone else is reading my thoughts. I have gained a lot of confidence in my reflections over the last couple weeks though that's for sure.
