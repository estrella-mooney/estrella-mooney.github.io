      <h1 class="bold-text">What is emotional intelligence? 
      </h1>
   <ol> 
Emotional intelligence is typically broken down into four core components. 
    <li>Self-awareness</li>
    <li>Self-management</li>
    <li>Social awareness</li>
    <li>Relationship management</li>
   </ol>
   <ul>
   <li>Everything revolves around self-awareness. It speaks to your capacity to comprehend your strengths and shortcomings as well as your emotions and how they affect both your performance and that of your team.</li>
   <li>Self-management is the capacity to control your emotions, particularly in demanding circumstances, and keep a positive attitude despite setbacks. Lack of self-control makes leaders more reactive and less adept at controlling their emotions.</li>
   <li> Understanding and controlling your own emotions are crucial, but you also need to be able to read a room. Your capacity to discern the feelings of others and the organisational dynamics at work is referred to as social awareness. </li>
   <li>Relationship management is the capacity to persuade, coach, mentor, and successfully resolve disagreement with others. While some people want to avoid conflict, it's crucial to effectively handle problems when they come up.</li>
   </ul>
   <h1 class="bold-text">How is EQ different from IQ?  </h1>
   <p>While IQ is a measure of ability to solve problems and think logically, EQ measures your ability to understand and manage emotions. </p>
   <h1 class="bold-text">Why is EQ important?   </h1>
   <p>You can sympathise with others, communicate clearly, and be socially and self-aware if you possess a high level of emotional intelligence. Our settings at home and at work are impacted by how we react to ourselves and others. Living in this world entails engaging with a wide variety of people, as well as experiencing constant change and surprises. How you react to the challenges of life depends on your emotional intelligence. It's also a crucial element of compassion and comprehending the deeper motivations behind other people's behaviour.
  </p>
  <p>When you are coping with challenging circumstances like conflict, change, and barriers, whether that be in the workplace, or in your private life, EI is extremely crucial. Being in tune with our emotions can assist us in remembering to practise compassion during these trying moments. Furthermore, Even if you are technically excellent at your profession, your technical prowess will be overshadowed if you lack the ability to work well with others or communicate with your team.
