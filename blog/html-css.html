      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </h1>

    <p>When someone was disparaging someone else's work after they had done their best, I had to make a moral choice. When I addressed them, they admitted to acting improperly. I could have let it go, but doing so would have gone against my moral principles and made me feel very uneasy. Additionally, the person being discussed wasn't present to defend themselves, so I did. I still know I made the right decision.
