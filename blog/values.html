  <div class="intro-text">
      <h1 class="bold-text">This blog is to reflect my core personal values, my strengths and my weaknesses. 
      <p class="bold-text">My core personal values </p>
      </h1>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Family</li>
      <li>Honesty </li>
      <li>Loyalty</li>
      <li>Empathy</li>
      <li>Adventure</li>
      <li>Curiosity/ life long learning</li>
      <li>Open-minded</li>
      <li>Self-awareness</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I did a personality test, and my result was Turbulent Mediator, INFP-T. <br> This is what it said : Turbulent Mediators are Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Prospecting and Turbulent. These rare types are often quiet, open-minded, and imaginative, applying care and creativity. </p>

    <h1 class="bold-text">
      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </h1>

    <p>When someone was disparaging someone else's work after they had done their best, I had to make a moral choice. When I addressed them, they admitted to acting improperly. I could have let it go, but doing so would have gone against my moral principles and made me feel very uneasy. Additionally, the person being discussed wasn't present to defend themselves, so I did. I still know I made the right decision. 
    </p>
    <h1 class="bold-text">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
    </h1>
    <p>My parents both come from different cultures, and thereby my identity and values are a mix of them both. 
    </p>
    <h1 class="bold-text">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
    </h1>
    <p>Being open minded will support my learning journey as I am always keen for new ideas and bringing different perspectives together to create an amazing outcome. I thrive in a team environment where how the team is feeling and the process is more important than the product result. Loyalty can also support my learning, as I am someone who can be counted on. I give it my all in group or solo efforts and persevere, especially when things get difficult. 
    </p>
    <h1 class="bold-text">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h1>
    <p>I can get overwhelmed by the different options of ideas and concepts, and sometimes find it difficult, like when researching for an essay, to only choose one main point when there are so many cool ones to talk about. This feeling of overwhelmingness could affect my learning journey as I get overwhelmed by all the information and shut down and self isolate. To try and avoid this I am challenging myself to let people know that I am overwhelmed, and asking for help. 
    </p>
    <h1 class="bold-text">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
    </h1>
    <p>There was a group project in uni, where we all had our sections of writing to complete. However, one member of the group didn't write their section until the last day. This created some tension during the process, as the rest of our group wanted to do well. I tried to ask them a couple times if they wanted to meet up in person or zoom in to see where we were at. And if they were stuck, or busy, if they wanted any help. They politely declined. But turned in their section on the last day. Reflecting on this, another strategy I would have tried was to have regular meetups every week to see where everyone is at, to make sure everyone feels supported, and no one gets left behind.
