          <h1>BOOTCAMP</h1>
      
      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway:</h3>
      <p>I want to get straight into working as a developer in the industry. I want to be an experienced devleoper, who can be counted on, not only in tech, but also in being there as a team member.  I want people to feel comfortable enough to come to me with their problems, and trust me to push them to be there best.  
        <br> And further down the track, on the tech side,  I want to work in the science based research on wildlife and their habitats. I want to something that is meaningful, that it creating something to help others, and mainly helping animals. 
     </p>

     <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp:</h3>
     <p>I am extremely motivated, and have been self-driven in my studies for many years now. Working in tech, is a big driver for me, and so it will help me push through those more difficult times. I love working in team environments, and doing so really aids in my learning. I am an extremely visual learner, and so can learn super fast if I am able to use this to my advantage. On the other-hand, I get overwhelmed with a lot of theory and text, which makes me learn a lot slower, and I can get overwhelmed and self isolate. 
    </p>

    <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be:</h3>
    <p>Staying on top of my work will be one of my main challenges. And keeping that motivation going for 9 weeks. Also making sure I don't just agree to things when working with a team, and actually stating my opinion. 
    </p>

    <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy:</h3>
    <p>I would like to work on my confidence in group projects, not being scare to put my ideas out there. And learning to not care too much about what others think about where I am in my learning with tech. As everyone has different ways of learning. 
    </p>

    <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team:</h3>
    <p>To support me in my learning needs, in the way that I need visual and active demonstrations of things. This is how I learn, and with this technique I can actually learn fast. If I am just given a set of instructions, it takes me a lot longer. To encourage me to make mistakes, as that's a part of learning that I do tend to forget sometimes. And to push my to speak my mind in group projects, not just listening to everyone elses. 
    </p>
    <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp:</h3>
    <p>To study hard, and push myself to continue my learning once 'class' is over, in order to maximise my learning from this course. To approach everything with determination. To take myself on walks, spend time with friends every once in a while, and in general take care of myself. As I have learnt that forcing myself to study for hours on end,is not going to help me learn. I  need to go to rehab for my back, and make sure I'm extremely careful with how long I am sitting so I don't get any flare ups. Overall give this course my absolute full attention, and try my hardest in all aspects.

    <h1>FOUNDATIONS</h1>
    <h3>
      What is your long term goal or career pathway?
    </h3>

    <p>To create solutions for our society and science based research on wildlife and their habitats. <br>“It’s better to fail while striving for something wonderful, challenging, adventurous, and uncertain, than to say, ’I don’t want to try because I may not succeed completely.'” (Jimmy Carter) <br> "Life is not a spectator sport. If you're going to spend your whole life in the grandstand just watching what goes on, in my opinion you're wasting your life." — Jackie Robinson <br>"If you don't like the road you're walking, start paving another one." — Dolly Parton</p>
    <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Strengths: I love working in a team environment, this helps in my learning, as learning together with others really plants concepts into my brain. I am hardworking, and even when I don’t understand what’s going on, I will push myself to get to where I want. It may take a bit longer with some things, but I get there which is the most important. Having done a lot of online learning over the past years, I have become extremely self-driven. Overall I love learning and developing new skills. 
      </li>
      <li>Limitations: If a lot of theory is thrown at me, I can get overwhelmed, and self-isolate. Need to work on taking breaks to get outside, exercise and breathe fresh air. And not eat unhealthy food if I feel stressed. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h3>
   <p>I would like to work on my speaking confidence, not being scared to put my ideas out there. 
  </p>
    <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
    </h3>
    <p>I am going to ask for help after 15-20 minutes of not understanding something. I need to make sure that I get outside, go exercise, and take lots of active breaks. As I have found, that's the only thing that can relax my brain. And taking time for myself, alone time is essential. 
     </p>
    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
    </h3>
    <p>Talk to my team members, cohort, and facilitators if I feel I need help.
    </p>
    <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
    </h3>
    <p>To demonstrate concepts in a visual way, not just theoretical. As I find it difficult with too much theory. I need hands-on projects to get stuff into my head. 
    </p>
    <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h3>
    <p>Some weekends I need to make sure I hang out with my friends. Evenings or morning (whatever schedule I choose when I come to Wellington) for fitness. 
    </p>
