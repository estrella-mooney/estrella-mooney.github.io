      <h1 class="bold-text">This blog is to show my learning plan for my time at Dev Academy
      </h1>
    

    <h1 class="bold-text">
      What is your long term goal or career pathway?
    </h1>

    <p>To create solutions for our society and science based research on wildlife and their habitats. <br>“It’s better to fail while striving for something wonderful, challenging, adventurous, and uncertain, than to say, ’I don’t want to try because I may not succeed completely.'” (Jimmy Carter) <br> "Life is not a spectator sport. If you're going to spend your whole life in the grandstand just watching what goes on, in my opinion you're wasting your life." — Jackie Robinson <br>"If you don't like the road you're walking, start paving another one." — Dolly Parton</p>
    <h1 class="bold-text">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Strengths: I love working in a team environment, this helps in my learning, as learning together with others really plants concepts into my brain. I am hardworking, and even when I don’t understand what’s going on, I will push myself to get to where I want. It may take a bit longer with some things, but I get there which is the most important. Having done a lot of online learning over the past years, I have become extremely self-driven. Overall I love learning and developing new skills. 
      </li>
      <li>Limitations: If a lot of theory is thrown at me, I can get overwhelmed, and self-isolate. Need to work on taking breaks to get outside, exercise and breathe fresh air. And not eat unhealthy food if I feel stressed. </li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="bold-text">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h1>
   <p>I would like to work on my speaking confidence, not being scared to put my ideas out there. 
  </p>
    <h1 class="bold-text">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
    </h1>
    <p>I am going to ask for help after 15-20 minutes of not understanding something. I need to make sure that I get outside, go exercise, and take lots of active breaks. As I have found, that's the only thing that can relax my brain. And taking time for myself, alone time is essential. 
     </p>
    <h1 class="bold-text">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
    </h1>
    <p>Talk to my team members, cohort, and facilitators if I feel I need help.
    </p>
    <h1 class="bold-text">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
    </h1>
    <p>To demonstrate concepts in a visual way, not just theoretical. As I find it difficult with too much theory. I need hands-on projects to get stuff into my head. 
    </p>
    <h1 class="bold-text">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h1>
    <p>Some weekends I need to make sure I hang out with my friends. Evenings or morning (whatever schedule I choose when I come to Wellington) for fitness. 
    </p>
